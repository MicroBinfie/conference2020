* Join the conference Discord server and interact with attendees.
* Observe the code of conduct

* After a speaking session, return back to the discord for questions and discussion.

## Connecting to Discord
A conference usually has a brick and mortar venue where people and mingle, and talk science. For the virtual conference, we will use Discord to fill in this role. Discord is a VoIP application that allows multiple text and voice channels and video conferencing for small groups. 

The server will be running between speaking sessions if you want to continue the conversation. Zoom is free to download and install, and available on all computer operating systems and most mobile devices.
