## Discovery of a new lineage of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
The human- and animal-adapted lineages of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) are thought to have clonally expanded from a common progenitor in Africa. However, the molecular events that accompanied this emergence remain largely unknown. Here, we describe two MTBC strains isolated from patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, representing an as-yet-unknown lineage, named Lineage 8 (L8), restricted to the African Great Lakes region. Using genome-based phylogenetic reconstruction, we show that L8 is a sister clade to the known MTBC lineages. Comparison with other complete mycobacterial genomes indicate that the divergence of L8 preceded the loss of the cobF genome region - involved in the cobalamin/vitamin B12 synthesis - and gene interruptions in a subsequent common ancestor shared by all other known MTBC lineages. This discovery further supports an East African origin for the MTBC and provides additional molecular clues on the ancestral genome reduction associated with adaptation to a pathogenic lifestyle.

## Combating shigellosis in endemic settings with pathogen genomic 
The Global Enteric Multicentre Study (GEMS) identified Shigella as one of the leading causes of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children across seven African and Asian countries. However, increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and lack of a licensed vaccine, means that treatment and management options for shigellosis are limited. Whole-genome sequencing analysis (WGSA) can be effectively used to investigate AMR and epidemiological surveillance of Shigella, but this has yet to be applied in countries where childhood mortality rates are the highest and the disease is endemic. Here, we performed WGSA of Shigella isolates from GEMS (255 S. sonnei and 759 S. flexneri) to explore the implications of AMR and genetic diversity relating to vaccination, to improve interventions and management of shigellosis.

We detected multiple, independent acquisitions of mutations conferring reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (the current recommended treatment) among isolates from Asia, reflecting selection due to heavy usage of the drug in these regions. While vaccination is a good alternative for management of shigellosis, we revealed implications which may impact the likely effectiveness of multiple approaches. These include, sequence variation within known epitopes of several antigen-vaccine candidates (eg. IpaB). Serotype switching, which may compromise immune protection induced by serotype-specific glycoconjugate vaccines. To help inform effective implementation of such vaccination programs, temporal analysis was used to estimate anticipated time frames over which serotype switching may lead to vaccine escape. In conclusion, WGSA of this representative dataset has provided valuable information to guide treatment and management of shigellosis through antimicrobial therapy and vaccination.
