We working on ways to best translate the conference experience into a virtual meeting, including the social/networking aspect. Sessions will start after mid-April. Each session is scheduled every Wednesday, running over several weeks. The dates include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>15th April 2020</li>\n<li>22nd April 2020</li>\n<li>29th April 2020</li>\n<li>6th May 2020</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are four sessions with four topics. Generally, talks would include microbes - viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc - and the talks would have a component of shotgun sequencing, and downstream bioinformatics analysis. Talks do not have to be limited to this scope, i.e. if wet lab results are required to present a clear narrative then they should, by all means, be included.  Purely methodological presentations are also welcome.Speakers can choose how long they wish to speak (up to 30 minutes)We are looking for speakers in a couple of slots.Microbial ecology and evolution (2 speakers required)\nThis session relates to microbes in their relationship in the wider environment. This can be represented in different ways, either as a network of functional systems or interplay of  species. We are interested in both. Talks that would present how we measure such relationships would also be welcome.Clinical microbiology (1 speaker required)\nThis session relates to microbial pathogens and their genomics. Talks in this session would naturally lean to a public health application, but this doesn’t have to be explicitly demonstrated.Population genetics and Microbial epidemiology (0 speakers required - at this time)\nThis session relates to the genetic differences within and without populations. This includes broad brush phenomena  like adaptation, speciation and population structure; and the detailed forensics of outbreaks.Bioinformatics protocols and methods (0 speakers required - at this time)\nThis session will have talks present algorithms, paradigms and protocols of interest to the microbial genomics and bioinformatics community.So if you are interested in speaking, or even just attending, please register via this form: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/o2RkFARgrRaxhzxH8\">https://forms.gle/o2RkFARgrRaxhzxH8</a> </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about"}}
