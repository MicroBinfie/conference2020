EnteroBase has currently assembled more than 400,000 genomes from Illumina short reads from Salmonella, Escherichia and five other bacterial genera, and genotyped most of these genomes by core genome Multilocus Sequence Typing (cgMLST). Hierarchical clustering of cgMLST sequence types allows mapping a new bacterial strain to predefined population structures at multiple levels of resolution and thus dynamic tracking of transmission chains. The interactive graphical user interface in EnteroBase eases the access of large scale bacterial genomic data and facilitates international data sharing and collaborations. I demonstrated the use of EnteroBase with multiple examples in Salmonella and Escherichia (30 mins)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/zheminzhou\">https://github.com/zheminzhou</a></p>\n<h2>Intro to IRIDA Pipeline Plugins</h2>\n<p>Quick intro to the IRIDA system (irida.ca), followed by brief discussion of how to develop your own ‘Pipeline Plugins’</p>\n<p>Dan Fornika is a Molecular Biologist + Bioinformatician = ‘Genomics Specialist’ (<a href=\"https://github.com/dfornika\">https://github.com/dfornika</a>)</p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/handwriting/","/tags/learning-to-write/"],"slug":"/posts/session-1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Session 1, 15th April 2020","tags":["Handwriting","Learning to write"],"date":"2020-04-15T15:00:00Z","description":"Quisque cursus, metus vitae pharetra auctor, sem massa mattis sem, at interdum magna augue eget diam.
