However, increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and lack of a licensed vaccine, means that treatment and management options for shigellosis are limited. Whole-genome sequencing analysis (WGSA) can be effectively used to investigate AMR and epidemiological surveillance of Shigella, but this has yet to be applied in countries where childhood mortality rates are the highest and the disease is endemic. Here, we performed WGSA of Shigella isolates from GEMS (255 S. sonnei and 759 S. flexneri) to explore the implications of AMR and genetic diversity relating to vaccination, to improve interventions and management of shigellosis.</p>\n<p>We detected multiple, independent acquisitions of mutations conferring reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (the current recommended treatment) among isolates from Asia, reflecting selection due to heavy usage of the drug in these regions. While vaccination is a good alternative for management of shigellosis, we revealed implications which may impact the likely effectiveness of multiple approaches. These include, sequence variation within known epitopes of several antigen-vaccine candidates (eg. IpaB). Serotype switching, which may compromise immune protection induced by serotype-specific glycoconjugate vaccines. To help inform effective implementation of such vaccination programs, temporal analysis was used to estimate anticipated time frames over which serotype switching may lead to vaccine escape. In conclusion, WGSA of this representative dataset has provided valuable information to guide treatment and management of shigellosis through antimicrobial therapy and vaccination.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://baker-lab.github.io/\">https://baker-lab.github.io/</a></p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/clinical-microbiology/","/tags/population-genetics-and-microbial-epidemiology/"],"slug":"/posts/session-3"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Session 3, 29nd April 2020","tags":["Clinical microbiology","Population genetics and Microbial epidemiology"],"date":"2020-04-29T16:00:00Z","description":"With talks from Taylor Paisie, Federica Palma and Melinda Ashcroft"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/session-3"}}
